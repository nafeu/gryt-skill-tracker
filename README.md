# gryt | skill tracker

A simple gamification and tracking system for skills that are being learned or practiced.

## About

This project is an old mobile-app and breakable toy project of mine from 2015 that I am porting into an Electron app. It received strong positive feedback and use from my peers. It was how I learned Ionic Framework and AngularJS (before ReactJS came along and decimated everything)

*** Porting still in progress...
